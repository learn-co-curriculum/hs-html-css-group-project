## HTML/CSS GROUP PROJECT

###The Task:

In groups of 3-5, you will be building a choose your own adventure site!

###What does that even mean?
A choose your own adventure game is written from 2nd person point of view ('you' is your pronoun of choice). The reader will take on the role of the protagonist in this adventure, aka they're the hero. The decisions of the reader will determine the plot and final outcome of this game. 

Still confused? Check out [this](http://pbskids.org/itsmylife/games/mortifying/) example.

Your goal is to build out as many options for your reader as possible. 

### The Steps:

You must spend 30 minutes planning your site. Planning is two-fold:

**1** Your group must build out a story board for your game. A storyboard is a graphic representation of the plot, like [this](https://www.teachervision.com/creative-writing/activity/3139.html).

**2**


###The stipulations:
Things your page must have:

**1** Correct HTML structure (doctype, html, head, title, and  body tags)

**2** 3 different fonts (from Google Fonts or not)

**3** A centered image

**4** An unordered or ordered list

**5**
