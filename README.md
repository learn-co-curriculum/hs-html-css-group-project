## HTML/CSS GROUP PROJECT

###The Task:

In groups of 3-5, you will be building a choose your own adventure site!

###What does that even mean?
A choose your own adventure game is written from 2nd person point of view ('you' is your pronoun of choice). The reader will take on the role of the protagonist in this adventure, aka they're the hero. The decisions of the reader will determine the plot and final outcome of this game. 

Still confused? Check out [this](http://pbskids.org/itsmylife/games/mortifying/) example.

Your goal is to build out as many options for your reader as possible.

### The Steps:

**1** Your group must build out a story board for your game. A storyboard is a graphic representation of the plot, like [this](https://www.teachervision.com/creative-writing/activity/3139.html). Don't worry, we'll go into it more in depth.

**2** Your group must build out a wireframe for the actual website. A wireframe is like a blueprint. It's a visual representation of the skeletal framework of the site. You don't need to create a wireframe for every page, but just have a general outline for what you want your site to look like. Here's an example:
<img src="http://www.kimbieler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/athayde-homepage.jpg">

Again, we'll tackle this more in depth as a group.

###The Stipulations:
Things your page(s) must have:

**1.** Correct HTML structure (doctype, html, head, title, and body tags)

**2.** Three different fonts (from Google Fonts or not)

**3.** A centered image

**4.** An unordered or ordered list

**5.** Copyright in the bottom right corner

**6.** Header and footer (same on all pages)

**7.** Header with h1-h6 tags

**8.** One opaque image

**9.** Border around header or footer

**10.** Background color on 1 page

**BONUS!** Embed a video or sound
